# A ball is thrown at a 45Â° angle from a height of 5 ft with an initial velocity of 75 ft/s.
# The height of the ball at time t can be approximated by the equation y = -16t2 + 53t + 5.
# Find the height of the ball at t = 2 s.

# time variable
time = 2

print("The height of the ball after", time , "seconds is", -16 * time ** 2 + 53 * time + 5, "ft.")
