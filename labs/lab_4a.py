    print("Sorry, there was no winner.")


# If both guesses are equally close, print stating there are no winners.

# You will likely have to use abs() which calculates the absolute value
# of the argument. bs(5) = 5, abs(-5) = 5, abs(0) = 0.

# You can assume ideal input â€“ users will not type the same guess.

# HINT: Print the random number before prompting the users so the
# program is easier to debug.
